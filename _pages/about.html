                I am a second year Master of Science student
                at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
                in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science.
                I also earned my Bachelor's degree here
                majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science.
                I am a part of the <b>Computing Education Research Area</b>,
                and my advisor is the wonderful <a href="https://mfsilva.web.illinois.edu/">Mariana Silva</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest lies in building educational tools to improve student learning,
                with autograding tools being the main focus.
                My current research involves building and evaluating an
                <b>Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG)</b> system to
                promote instant feedback in various open-ended response problems,
                and studying how and when the feedback can be helpful.
                I am employed half-time as a software developer in
                <a href="https://www.prairielearn.com/">PrairieLearn</a>,
                where I am responsible for developing the ASAG system.
                I am also interested in understanding the perspectives of students,
                teaching assistants, and instructors on using potentially unreliable systems for assessment.
