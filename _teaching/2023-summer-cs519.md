excerpt: Improving the autograder so it can provide better feedback on student code.
---

I worked for the graduate level visualization class even before taking it during the summer. I was lucky to have many Teaching Assistants in the team with me who are equipped with the necessary knowledge for the class so I don't have to worry about the knowledge myself. Over the course of the summer, I worked on the coding autograders in the course to make it provide more concrete and constructive feedback to the students.
