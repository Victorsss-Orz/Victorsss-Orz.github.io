This was my first experience working as a staff for any course. I worked two years in total as a CA, during which I was nominated to receive the [Outstanding Course Assistant Award](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/awards/undergraduate-scholarships-awards/outstanding-course-assistants). My main duties were: 

- Hold regular office hours
- Attend weekly synchronous group activity sessions
- Develop and test quiz questions
- Improve existing autograders for course assessments to provide better feedback
- Improve quality for course notes
