As a first-year graduate student, I continued my work for Numerical Methods, giving me a third year as a course staff. In one of the semesters, I also served as the head TA for the courses, having some extra duties: 

- Substitute in for mini-lectures and syllabus course when the instructor is not available
- Lead bi-weekly study halls to solve challenging problems in class
- Perform weekly grade uploads and deal with excused absences
- Handle assignment or quiz extensions
