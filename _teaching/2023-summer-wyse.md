In the summer of 2023, I join the [Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE) Program](https://wyse.grainger.illinois.edu/) as a lab assistant for the Internet of Things program. I was in charge of the machine learning portion of the program, teaching high school students some basic machine learning knowledge using PyTorch and TensorFlow. Students built a simple handwriting digit classifier during the program.
