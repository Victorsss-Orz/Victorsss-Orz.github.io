## Introduction

In the University of Illinois's [Computer-Based Testing Facility](https://cbtf.illinois.edu), there has historically only been
physical TI calculators offered as the calculator of choice during various exams. However, the complexity of
the functions and the lack of clear documentation on TI calculators often result in students being unsure of
how to use them effectively.

Following a Universal Design for Learning approach, we build a web-based calculator inside PrairieLearn that
has similar functions to the real TI calculators with a more user-friendly interface. This would allow
students to access the same calculator interface both inside and outside the testing environment to gain the
necessary familiarity.
