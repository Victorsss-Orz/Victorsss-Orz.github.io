## Introduction

The CS 101 course, required by most non-CS majors in the Grainger College of
Engineering, has historically equipped students with Python and Matlab programming skills essential for
solving engineering problems. However, the course's effectiveness has been diluted over time due to
an overemphasis on diverse engineering applications and outdated content material, undermining its
programming rigor.

In this project, we propose a comprehensive redesign of CS 101,focusing on re-establishing basic programming
fundamentals (CS1) during lectures while integrating diverse engineering applications into lab sections and
bi-weekly mini-projects. Drawing on qualitative feedback from interviews with over 10 faculty members across
both Computer Science and other Grainger Departments, we propose to develop a curriculum that balances CS1
topics with practical engineering applications, create new lecture content reflecting CS1 learning
objectives, create auto-graded and randomized questions on PrairieLearn to support mastery learning during
homework, enhance the lab sections through Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning, develop mini-projects
applied to engineering applications, and design concept inventory questions to measure the impact of our
course redesign. Our goal is to ensure that engineering students are better equipped with the computational
skills necessary to navigate and innovate within their respective engineering fields.
